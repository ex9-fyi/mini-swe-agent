Back then, we placed a lot of emphasis on tools and special interfaces for the agent. However, one year later, a lot of this is not needed at all to build a useful agent!</p> <p>In fact, micro-SWE-agent:</p> <ul> <li>Does not have any tools other than bash \u2014 it doesn't even use the tool-calling interface of the LMs. This means that you can run it with literally any model. When running in sandboxed environments you also don't need to take care of installing a single package \u2014 all it needs is bash.</li> <li>Has a completely linear history \u2014 every step of the agent just appends to the messages and that's it. So there's no difference between the trajectory and the messages that you pass on to the LM.</li> <li>Executes actions with <code>subprocess.run</code> \u2014 every action is completely independent (as opposed to keeping a stateful shell session running). This makes it trivial to execute the actions in sandboxes (literally just switch out <code>subprocess.run</code> with <code>docker exec</code>) and to scale up effortlessly.</li> </ul> <p>This makes it perfect as a baseline system and for a system that puts the language model (rather than the agent scaffold) in the middle of our attention.</p> Why use micro-SWE-agent as a tool? <p>Some agents are overfitted research artifacts. Others are UI-heavy tools, highly optimized for a specific user experience. Both variants are hard to understand.</p> <p><code>micro</code> wants to be:</p> <ul> <li>Simple enough to understand at a glance</li> <li>Convenient enough to use in daily workflows</li> <li>Flexible to extend</li> </ul> <p>A hackable tool, not a black box.</p> <p>Unlike other agents (including our own swe-agent), it is radically simpler, because it:</p> <ul> <li>Does not have any tools other than bash \u2014 it doesn't even use the tool-calling interface of the LMs.</li> <li>Has a completely linear history \u2014 every step of the agent just appends to the messages and that's it.</li> <li>Executes actions with <code>subprocess.run</code> \u2014 every action is completely independent (as opposed to keeping a stateful shell session running).</li> </ul> Should I use SWE-agent or micro-SWE-agent? <p>You should use micro-swe-agent if</p> <ul> <li>You want a quick command line tool that works locally</li> <li>You want an agent with a very simple control flow</li> <li>You want even faster, simpler &amp; more stable sandboxing &amp; benchmark evaluations</li> </ul> <p>You should use swe-agent if</p> <ul> <li>You need specific tools or want to experiment with different tools</li> <li>You want to experiment with different history processors</li> <li>You want very powerful yaml configuration without touching code</li> </ul> <p>What you get with both</p> <ul> <li>Excellent performance on SWE-Bench</li> <li>A trajectory browser</li> </ul> Simple UI (<code>micro</code>)  Visual UI (<code>micro -v</code>)  Batch inference Trajectory browser Python bindings More in the docs <pre><code>agent = DefaultAgent(\n    LitellmModel(model_name=...),\n    LocalEnvironment(),\n)\nagent.run(\"Write a sudoku game\")</code></pre> <ul> <li>Quick start</li> <li><code>micro</code></li> <li>FAQ</li> <li>Configuration</li> <li>Power up</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#continue-reading","title":"Continue reading:","text":"launch Installation &amp; Quick Start <p>Get started with micro-SWE-agent</p> flash_on Usage: Simple UI <p>Learn to use the <code>micro</code> command</p> visibility Usage: Visual UI <p>Try the visual interface with <code>micro -v</code></p> help FAQ <p>Common questions and answers</p> settings Configuration <p>Setup and customize your agent</p> fitness_center Power up <p>Start hacking the agent!</p> bug_report Something broken/unclear? <p>Open an issue on GitHub!</p> help Open-ended discussions <p>Join our Slack!</p>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#101-2025-07-22","title":"1.0.1 (2025-07-22)","text":""},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#fixed","title":"Fixed","text":"<ul> <li><code>micro-extra</code> and <code>micro-e</code> invocation</li> </ul>"},{"location":"SECURITY/","title":"Security Policy","text":""},{"location":"SECURITY/#reporting-a-vulnerability","title":"Reporting a Vulnerability","text":"<p>Please contact Kilian Lieret (kl5675@princeton.edu), John Yang (johnby@stanford.edu), Carlos E.

It does the following:</p> <ol> <li>Queries the model for a response based on the current messages (<code>DefaultAgent.query</code>, calling <code>Model.query</code>)</li> <li>Parses the response to get the action, i.e., the shell command to execute (<code>DefaultAgent.parse_action</code>)</li> <li>Executes the action in the environment (<code>DefaultAgent.execute_action</code>, calling <code>Environment.execute</code>)</li> <li>Renders the observation message with <code>DefaultAgent.render_template</code></li> <li>Adds the observation to the messages</li> </ol> <p>The interesting bit is how we handle error conditions and the finish condition: This uses exceptions of two types: <code>TerminatingException</code> and <code>NonTerminatingException</code>.</p> <ul> <li><code>TerminatingException</code> is raised when the agent has finished its task or we hit a limit (cost, step limit, etc.)</li> <li> <p><code>NonTerminatingException</code> is raised when the agent has not finished its task, but we want to continue the loop.    In this case, all we need to do is to add a new message to the messages list, so that the LM can see the new state.    There are two typical cases that we handle this way:</p> <ol> <li><code>TimeoutError</code>: the action took too long to execute (we show partial output)</li> <li><code>FormatError</code>: the output from the LM contained zero or multiple actions (we show the error message)</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>The <code>DefaultAgent.run</code> method catches these exceptions and handles them by adding the corresponding message to the messages list and continuing the loop.</p> <pre><code>while True:\n    try:\n        self.step()\n    except NonTerminatingException as e:\n        self.add_message(\"user\", str(e))\n    except TerminatingException as e:\n        self.add_message(\"user\", str(e))\n        return type(e).__name__, str(e)\n</code></pre> <p>Using exceptions for the control flow is a lot easier than passing around flags and states, especially when extending or subclassing the agent.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/cookbook/","title":"Cookbook","text":"<p>We provide several different entry points to the agent, for example hello world, or the default when calling <code>micro</code>.</p> <p>Want to cook up your custom version and the config is not enough?

Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n    2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n    ## Important Boundaries\n    - MODIFY: Regular source code files in {{working_dir}}\n    - DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n    ## Recommended Workflow\n    1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n    2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n    3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n    4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n    5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n    ## Command Execution Rules\n    You are operating in an environment where\n    1. You write a single command\n    2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n    3. You see the result\n    4. You write your next command\n\n    Each response should include:\n    1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n    2. A single bash code block with your command\n\n    Format your responses like this:\n\n    &lt;format_example&gt;\n    THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\n    and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n    ```bash\n    your_command_here\n    ```\n    &lt;/format_example&gt;\n\n    Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:\n\n    ```bash\n    your_command_here\n    ```\n\n    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n    - Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n    - Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n    - This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with &amp;&amp; or ||)\n    - If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n    - Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n    - Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n    - However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir &amp;&amp; ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n    Example of a CORRECT response:\n    &lt;example_response&gt;\n    THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.\n\n    ```bash\n    ls -la\n    ```\n    &lt;/example_response&gt;\n\n    Example of an INCORRECT response:\n    &lt;example_response&gt;\n    THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.\n\n    ```bash\n    ls -la\n    ```\n\n    Now I'll read the file:\n\n    ```bash\n    cat file.txt\n    ```\n    &lt;/example_response&gt;\n\n    If you need to run multiple commands, either:\n    1. Combine them in one block using &amp;&amp; or ||\n    ```bash\n    command1 &amp;&amp; command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n    ```\n\n    2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n    ## Environment Details\n    - You have a full Linux shell environment\n    - Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n    - Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n    - If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n    ## Useful Command Examples\n\n    ### Create a new file:\n    ```bash\n    cat &lt;&lt;'EOF' &gt; newfile.py\n    import numpy as np\n    hello = \"world\"\n    print(hello)\n    EOF\n    ```\n\n    ### Edit files with sed:\n    ```bash\n    # Replace all occurrences\n    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n    # Replace only first occurrence\n    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n    # Replace first occurrence on line 1\n    sed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n    # Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\n    sed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n    ```\n\n    ### View file content:\n    ```bash\n    # View specific lines with numbers\n    nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n    ```\n\n    ### Any other command you want to run\n    ```bash\n    anything\n    ```\n\n    ## Submission\n    When you've completed your changes or can't make further progress\n    issue exactly the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    echo MICRO_SWE_AGENT_FINAL_OUTPUT &amp;&amp; git add -A &amp;&amp; git diff --cached\n    ```\n\n    This command will submit your changes.\n    You cannot continue working on this task after submitting.\n    &lt;/instructions&gt;\n  action_observation_template: |\n    &lt;returncode&gt;{{output.returncode}}&lt;/returncode&gt;\n    {% if output.output | length &lt;
